Wallet is a simple feature that provides a dedicated [command](../commands#dedicated-commands) to view balance of all currencies together.

You can toggle this feature in the **config.yml** -> `Wallet` -> `Enabled`

Wallet aliases can be changed in the **config.yml** -> `Wallet` -> `Command_Aliases`

:::note
Players won't see the balance of currencies for which they don't have [permissions](../permissions).

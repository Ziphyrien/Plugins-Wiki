If you do not agree with our rules, you will not be able to receive our service support. Users who violate the rules will be punished according to the situation, including permanent ban.
* Every user is obligated to comply with our plugin terms of use. You can find these in the **LICENSE** file within the JAR file. We do not provide any assistance to users who fail to comply with the terms of use.
* Compared to users who have purchased the paid version, our service support priority for free users will be lower, with more requirements and restrictions. I have invested a lot of time and effort in developing plugins, but despite this, I have provided a free version and the complete plugin source code. I have not closed the source or restricted the number of user IP addresses used. Therefore, better service support is not free, and you should not ask me to provide good service for free. If you want your issue to be taken seriously, please consider purchasing a paid version to support plugin development.
* Support is only available at our [Discord](https://discord.gg/rzajeybhbw) server.&#x20;

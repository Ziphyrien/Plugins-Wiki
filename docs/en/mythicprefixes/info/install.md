* Put the `.jar` file into your server's `plugins` folder.
* Stop your server and then restart it. <mark style="color:red;">Cannot load plugins in any other way while the server is starting</mark>.
* When updating plugins, please be sure to remove old versions.
* Previously, you used the free version, but now to upgrade to the paid version, you only need to install the paid version on the server and remove the free version. The configuration file of the plugin does not require any changes.
* MythicPrefixes is just a **tag manager** plugin, <mark style="color:red;">we do not auto add prefix at chat/tab/scoreboard</mark>, you have to use other plugins like **TAB**, and use our [Placeholders](https://mythicprefixes.superiormc.cn/info/compatibility) in them to display the tag.
